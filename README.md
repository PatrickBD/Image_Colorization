Image Colorization Using Autoencoders and Resnet

This notebook is made to work on Kaggle and uses Kaggle datasets. See and fork the notebook here: https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/image-colorization-using-autoencoders-and-resnet

This notebook colorizes grayscale images using a fusion of autoencoders and Resnet neural networks. The data is trained on ~2000 classic art paintings that were converted to grayscale and attempted to recolor. The NN uses a Resnet classifier to identify objects in the images to get a sense of what things should be colored.
